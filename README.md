### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Amritz, a final-year engineering student at the University of Cambridge. Outside of my degree-work, I'm currently working on how to collect and use data to obtain some interesting insights - the latest of which has involved finding out all scores that have happened in Super League.

Find me on these sites, too!
